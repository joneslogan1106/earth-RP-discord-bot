Over the last year, over 50 such cases of senseless murder have been reported, and the special forces of the Romanian police have been given the task to, alongside normal units, arrest those responsible until the trial concludes, and from there, based on the evidence and actions, would be given sentences of anywhere from 15-25 years in jail, with no possibility for parole or pardons under any circumstance. They would also have to wear ankle bracelets so the police knows their exact location at any time.
