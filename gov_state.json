      "command": "<@1276210518171975823> \n\nFirst of all, both countries are already in the European Union, which already handles trade, large parts of regulation, and in Slovakia\u2019s case, monetary policy through the euro. Slovakia uses the euro. Czechia does not. Your treaty proposes a new joint currency by 2032. For Slovakia, that would mean leaving the eurozone, which is politically and legally complex, and economically risky. For Czechia, it would mean skipping euro adoption in favor of a bespoke bilateral currency. In the current climate, neither side has strong incentive to do that.\n\nSecondly, both states are NATO members. NATO already integrates military planning, procurement, and interoperability. A fully unified Federal Armed Forces with alternating supreme commanders would be symbolically powerful but functionally redundant within NATO structures. The geopolitical incentive is weak unless NATO collapses or there is a major regional shock. \n\nThird, domestic politics. In Czechia, there is little appetite for constitutional transformation on this scale. In Slovakia, politics has recently leaned toward stronger assertions of national sovereignty. A treaty that explicitly dissolves separate armed forces and creates a joint state structure would require constitutional amendments in both countries. That means supermajorities. And probably referendums in practice, even if not formally required. Public opinion today does not strongly favor refederalization.\n\nAlso, a 90 day constitutional drafting timeline is wildly optimistic. Constitution writing at this scale is measured in years, not months. Belgium took years to negotiate federal reforms. The EU constitutional process took years and still failed at first. Ninety days suggests either elite imposition or severe crisis conditions.\n\nThat\u2019s not even everything I could list. There is so much more.\n\nThis is only plausible under the following conditions:\n\nIt becomes plausible under specific scenarios:\n1. Major external security shock in Central Europe.\n2. EU fragmentation that pushes smaller states toward tighter regional blocs.\n3. Massive economic crisis that rewards consolidation.\n4. Strong charismatic leadership in both countries running explicitly on reunification platforms.",
