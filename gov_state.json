That's a powerful, tangible win for my public.\n\nBut my Finance Minister just screamed into his coffee. This creates a massive economic mechanism. We need ironclad rules:\n\nThe Rate: Who sets it? A joint central bank council? 1 EUR = 24 CZK? It has to be fixed, transparent, and reviewed annually.\nThe Cost: If Slovaks flood the border to buy cheaper Czech goods with this rate, who covers the potential loss to Czech merchants or the state? We'd need a joint stabilization fund.\nThe Lock: This must be a permanent, treaty-bound feature of any union. It can't be a 'promotional offer' you revoke in 5 years.\nYou give us this guaranteed rate, and I will stand beside you and call it the 'Slovak Shopping Guarantee.'

Every 4-8 years, the federal capital moves between Prague and Bratislava. The federal government physically relocates. This isn't symbolic. It's proof we are equal.\nDouble Veto. A Slovak and Czech member of the federal executive council must both agree on any major policy. We are two keys turning a single lock.\nOpt-Out with Teeth. Slovakia gets a permanent, treaty-protected right to opt-out of any federal law that overwhelmingly impacts our territory, without penalty. You do good things, we'll join. You try something we hate, we sit it out. This makes 'less control' a choice, not a condition.\nRebrand It. Not a \"Czechoslovak Reunification.\" Call it the \"Federation of the Czech and Slovak Republics\" or the \"Bohemian-Slovak Union.\" The name must be new.\nThe Money Bridge. Your dual-currency plan is the first 5-year phase. After that, we either adopt a new common currency (not just the CZK) or both fully join the Euro together. We meet in the middle, we don't adopt yours.\nYou offer this structure, and you are no longer the bigger brother asking for the house back.

We propose: Federal Parliament sits in Brno (a neutral, historically symbolic city). Executive & Presidential offices rotate every 4 years between Prague & Bratislava. This is the non-negotiable core of equal power.\n\n2. Double Veto. Unclear. \"Only in our territory\" means you could pass a federal law that only applies to Czechia without our input? That makes us irrelevant at the federal level. No. Double veto on ALL federal legislation and major appointments. Our voice must be equal in shaping the union, not just opting out of it. We cannot be junior partners in the federal chamber.\n\n3. Opt-Out. Good.\n\n4. Name. Czechian-Slovakian Union. Acceptable. The order of names will be a fight. We suggest \"The Union of Czech and Slovak Republics\" (UCSR). Clean, neutral.\n\n5. CS (CZSL) Currency by 2032. Yes, but on strict condition: It is a brand new currency, designed 50/50 by a joint central bank. It is not a renamed or dominant Czech koruna. The path is: Phase 1 (now): Dual Euro/CZK zone with fixed rate. Phase 2 (by 2030): Introduce the CZSL as a parallel currency. Phase 3 (by 2035): Fully replace both national currencies. This is a project we build together.\n\nMy Final Position: We have the outline of a historic deal. I will take Two Capitals (with Brno as parliamentary seat), True Double Veto on all federal matters, the Opt-Out clause, the UCSR name, and the joint CZSL currency plan to my National Council.\n\nIf you can confirm these points, I will authorize our ambassadors to begin drafting the founding treaty. We will then face our people together.\n\nThis is my last text on terms. Ball is in your court. A simple 'Agreed' or 'No' will suffice.\"",
