Our nations were once united until the Bolsheviks forced a separation, what followed after liberation from communism were very strong ties with Romania always intervening to help Moldova against either foreign aggression or natural disasters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic during which Romania donated very large quantities of medical equipment, etc.; it all goes to show that Romania has Moldova's best interests in mind and we wish to ensure that the people of Moldova are heard and the Russian Empire does not attempt to seize their freedoms once again. Despite how well Moldova's president Maia Sandu is at her job of ensuring Moldova remains a democratic nation, Moldova's armed forces are not up to the task of fighting anything more than the breakaway state of Transnistria; through this agreement, Romania would deploy a set amount of troops and equipment to Moldova to greatly improve the first response to outside threats, with Romania of course fully committing to the protection of Moldova in the event of a prolonged conflict, which this MDP seeks to avoid in the first place. This agreement would also see Moldovan troops being trained in Romania by the experienced Romanian armed forces alongside other NATO countries on a much more regular basis than before.*\n> \n> *In order to clarify any aspects, we would like to welcome her excellency the president herself to discuss the exact terms and benefits of such an agreement.* \n> \n> [Pictured: Romanian humanitarian aid convoy in Kishinev, met by Moldovan citizens on the streets]",

Recognizing the strategic imperative of Norway\u2019s border with Russia and the Norwegian Sea\u2019s role as the optimal route for Russia\u2019s Northern Fleet, the Ministry of Defence commits to increasing defence spending from 1.6% of GDP to 2% by 2027, injecting $2.5 billion USD annually, and aiming to reach 2.5% by 2029, to fund advanced capabilities; these resources, prioritize restructuring Norway\u2019s forces towards a more agile, asymmetric doctrine to counter conventional Russian threats, ensuring sovereignty and allied security. Norway\u2019s long coastline is our defensive priority, with budgeting made to support new naval infrastructure to restrict Russian access to the Norwegian Sea, safeguarding NATO\u2019s Northern flank.\n\nConscription reforms strengthen Norway\u2019s military resilience, mandating physical examinations and basic training for all eligible draftees, male and female; those declining active service must register with the Home Guard, maintaining physical fitness and participating in quarterly drills for three years, semi-annual checks until age 30, and annual formations until 35, ensuring a 70,000-strong reserve ready for rapid mobilization. Home Guard members are to receive housing subsidies through Husbanken and extended coverage of university semester fees, incentivizing service.\n\nThe Norwegian Armed Forces as while will undergo a strategic overhaul, the true change in doctrine is that Norway is restructuring the force so that all new recruits are to be marines, first and foremost. This means every infantryman receives advanced training in littoral and coastal operations, mirroring U.S. Marine versatility, along with Arctic warfare, capable of executing small-unit, intelligence-driven operations against larger adversaries, with $300 million allocated to establish a new Arctic Coastal training center in Troms og Finnmark, enhancing NATO interoperability for exercises and wargames. Additionally $200 million is allocated towards counter-naval systems, including shore-based Naval Strike Missile batteries to deter Baltic incursions. Norway also invests $250 million to work with our allies to upgrade and develop our intelligence and surveillance capabilities; upgrading radar networks & sharing real-time data capabilities with NATO to monitor Russian activity, reinforcing the Alliance\u2019s northern shield\u2026Golden Dome.",
